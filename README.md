## ‚ö†Ô∏è Responsible Use Warning

This project includes powerful features, such as bulk messaging, which can be easily interpreted as spam by Telegram. Improper use **can lead to the limitation or permanent banning of your account**.

-   **Use at your own risk.** The author is not responsible for any damage or blocks to your account.
-   **"Warm up" your account:** New accounts or those with low activity are more likely to be limited. Use them manually for a while before automating tasks.
-   **Do not spam:** Use this tool ethically and consciously.

## ‚ú® Features

Teleforge is a Swiss Army knife for Telegram power users, providing a collection of independent, on-demand tools:

#### Data & Analytics
-   **Chat Analyzer:** Get statistics on any chat, including the most active users and a breakdown of shared media types over a custom number of messages.
-   **Member Exporter:** Export the full member list of any group to a `.csv` file, including user IDs, names, and last seen status.
-   **Global Search:** Search for a keyword across *all* your chats (groups, channels, DMs) and save the results to a detailed text file.
-   **Chat History Archiver:** Create a full backup of a chat's text history to a `.txt` or `.json` file, with flexible date filters (all-time, today, yesterday, or a custom range).

#### Content & Media Management
-   **Advanced Media Downloader:** Download media from any chat with powerful filters for media type (photos, videos, docs) and/or a specific user.
-   **Image Watermarker:** Automatically apply a custom watermark to a batch of images from a local folder and upload them directly to a chat, with options for position, scale, and opacity.

#### Account & Chat Management
-   **Contact Manager:** Clean up your address book by finding and bulk-deleting deleted accounts or long-inactive contacts.
-   **Bulk Archiver:** Organize your chat list by archiving hundreds of chats at once based on rules like mute status or inactivity.
-   **Bulk Messenger:** Send direct messages to a random subset of group members, with built-in safety delays to mitigate spam detection.

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

2.  **Create the configuration file:** In the project's root directory, create a file named `config.ini` and fill it with your credentials, following the example below:

    ```ini
    [telegram_credentials]
    api_id = 1234567
    api_hash = abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890
